## Description

This repository contains machine learning models and algorithms for classifying heart attack diseases based on various medical parameters and risk factors. The project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart attacks in individuals using relevant clinical data.

## Key Features

- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to handle missing data, normalize features, and extract relevant information.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.
- Open-source contributions and collaboration opportunities for further improvement and refinement of the classification models.
